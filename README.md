# managment_task_file_message
I have developed a complete system, which includes a database server-side and a client-side. 
The system includes registration and login screens. 
Messaging system, and task management system. 
The system is divided according to the permissions of the employee, manager, and customer. 
The system also includes alerts that are sent to email when there are new documents or their due date is about to expire, 
and of course alerts that appear on the system screen when a task has not yet been performed. 

If you want to see the system in action, enter the following link:
